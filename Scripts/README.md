# Scripts

In this folder there are some general purpose scripts that might be useful when working with files, jobs and plotting.

## Structure modification

- [rotate_axis_xyz.py](./rotate_axis_xyz.py) - Python script that receives a `.xyz` file and rotate one axis into another. Might be useful to, for example, change the main axis of a nanotube from `y` to `z`, or change the orientation of a slab.

- [wrap_atoms_xyz.py](./wrap_atoms_xyz.py) - Python script that receives a `.xyz` file and wrap coordinates in one direction. Might be useful to, for example, to wrap coordinates only along the axial direction of a NT.
